![Spike example image](https://spike.opcodes.io/images/purchase-credits-emerald.webp)

Spike is a package for [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) allowing you to easily set up billing for your users. You can start charging subscriptions and one-off purchases easily with just a few lines of configuration. The user interface is already built for you, as well as payment and invoice handling.

## Installing

The package can be installed into an existing Laravel project. Here are the requirements before installing Spike:

- Laravel 10+
- PHP 8.1+
- Livewire 3+

To install Spike into your project, simply use the Composer command:

```shell
composer require opcodesio/spike
```

After that, just follow the [Getting started guide](https://spike.opcodes.io/docs/v3/getting-started) in our official documentation.

> **Note:** the above is slightly different from the previous paid version which was installed using `opcodes/spike` (notice the missing "io").

## Testing

composer test
```
